code repo for the advent of code challenges
This is an annual set of python coding challenges, with a new challenge to complete for each day during advent. 

I find it's a good way to creatively solve problems, practice making good variable names, coding style etc. And it's fun! 

Usually a group of us take part and talk about our solutions. It's interesting to see other people's approaches to the same problems.
